## Issues and Questions

* R scripts are in order of running 
* some parameter need to be defined, for example the getgeodata will only get geodata for Hessen. This can be made common for all states with a parameter from Shiny (Select your state) passed into this script
* this line is currently in the script but should be somewhere else..
